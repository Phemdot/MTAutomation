# Mobile Test Automation

This project is a mobile test automation framework, which provides structured and standard way of creating automated test scripts for Mobile and API level tests across project.

This is a reusable automation framework that blends together Selenium WebDriver, Appium, RestAssured, and Cucumber JVM (incorporating Gherkin and the BDD 'Given, When Then' testing construct)

This framework supports automation of : - 
*Mobile Automation on Emulated and Physical Devices, for Android Apps and extendable to iOS.

The framework incorporates design principle of BDD (Behaviour driven development) which promotes writing acceptance tests by describing behaviour of application under test in simple english language from the perspective of its stakeholders.

Supports Custom Page Object model which represents the screens of AUT as a series of objects and encapsulates the fields represented by a page which ultimately avoids duplication and improves code maintainability and readability.
